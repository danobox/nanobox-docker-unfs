# UNFS (User-Space Network File System) ![Build Status Image](https://travis-ci.org/nanobox-io/nanobox-docker-unfs.svg)

This is an UNFS Docker image used to launch a UNFS service on Nanobox. To use this image, add a data component to your `boxfile.yml` with the `nanobox/unfs` image specified:

## UNFS Configuration Options

There are no configuration options for UNFS services, but they work in conjunction with network directories. These are covered in detail in the [Nanobox Network Storage documentation](https://docs.nanobox.io/app-config/network-storage/).
